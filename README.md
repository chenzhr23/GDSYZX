qtWGCNA

Currently, qtWGCNA (v 1.0) is under its first version development. As showed in the below figure, the framework of qtWGCNA relies on a Qt-based fore-end and the back-end python script of iterativeWGCNA [1].

<strong>About qtWGCNA:</strong>
  qtWGCNA is developed as an interface of iterativeWGCNA python script, to run qtWGCNA, we can use WSL of Windows 10 (can be downloaded and installed from Microsoft store) or run command './qtWGCNA' on a linux server terminal. We recommend downloading WSL from Microsoft store in Win 10 system because it is more light weight and no requirement for complicated coding skills.
